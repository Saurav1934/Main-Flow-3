Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques

Objective

The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. By grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior, businesses can enhance their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and effectively target each segment.

Project Steps

Step 1: Dataset Selection

Dataset Name: customer_data.csvColumns:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Age: Age of the customer.

Annual Income: Customer's yearly income in dollars (or any currency).

Spending Score: A score assigned to customers based on their spending habits and behavior.

Step 2: Tasks to Perform

1. Load the Dataset

Utilize Pandas to import the dataset into a DataFrame.

Conduct an initial dataset inspection by checking:

Shape, missing values, duplicates, and data types.

Summary statistics to analyze the range of values.

2. Data Preprocessing

Standardize the data:

Apply a scaler such as StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler from sklearn to ensure uniform scaling across all features.

Standardization is crucial as clustering algorithms are sensitive to feature magnitudes.

3. Clustering Analysis

Determine the optimal number of clusters:

Utilize the Elbow Method:

Plot the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.

Identify the "elbow point" which suggests the optimal cluster count.

Alternatively, use the Silhouette Score for evaluation.

Apply K-Means Clustering:

Use the optimal cluster number obtained from the Elbow Method.

Assign cluster labels to customers accordingly.

4. Visualization

2D Scatter Plot:

Implement PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE to reduce dimensionality for visualization.

Represent clusters using distinct colors.

Pair Plots:

Visualize relationships between features within clusters.

Centroid Visuals:

Display the centroid of each cluster for better interpretation.
